C++ Qt Chat Application

Project Description

This is a local chat application written in C++ using Qt.
The program opens two separate windows on the same computer, simulating a conversation between two users.
Users can send and receive messages in real-time, providing a simple yet interactive chat experience.

This project helped me gain practical experience with Qt widgets, signals and slots, and C++ GUI programming.
